## Specification

1. With your partner, go through and complete the notebook `cw05.ipynb`. This notebook will demonstrate the implementation of useful functions, and how to plot them using `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`.
1. With any extra time, create a new notebook `plots.ipynb` and implement a few of the more interesting exercises from the following `matplotlib` tutorial for practice : https://www.labri.fr/perso/nrougier/teaching/matplotlib/

Pro-tip: using git to manage conflicts on Jupyter notebooks is a pain. I recommend delegating one person from your group to edit the notebook, to avoid merge conflicts.

## Assessment

Analyze in this section what you found useful about this assignment in your own words. Include any lingering questions or comments that you may have.

**We learned a lot about matplot, which seems to be a great way to plot and organize data. Combining numpy with data plotting is an efficient tool for displaying data in a reader friendly way.**
